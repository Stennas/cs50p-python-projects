# 🧠 Habit Tracker

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/0WlEhnBaDhU

#### Description: A simple and interactive habit tracker built in Python to help you stay consistent and build life-changing habits. Track daily progress, maintain streaks, and manage your personal growth — all from your terminal.

---

## ✨ Features
- Add Habits: Create new habits and categorize them.

- Daily Tracking: Mark habits as done each day. The app automatically updates your streak.

- Streaks: Track how many days in a row you've completed each habit.

- View Today's Progress: Quickly see which habits you’ve completed today and which remain.

- Edit or Delete Habits: Rename habits or remove them when no longer needed.

- Persistent Storage: All data is stored locally in a data.json file.

- Beginner-Friendly Codebase: Designed and written as a learning exercise, making it ideal for beginners who want to read and understand the code.

## 📂 Project Structure
habit-tracker/
  - project.py          # Main application file
  - data.json           # Stores habit data persistently
  - test_project.py     # Unit tests written with pytest
  - README.md           # Project overview and documentation



## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Start the app** from your terminal:
   ```bash
   python main.py

2. Choose from the menu:

  -  View today's habits

  -  Add a new habit

  -  Mark a habit as done

  -  Edit or delete an existing habit

3. Habit data is saved to data.json, so your streaks and history persist across sessions.


## 🧪 Running Tests
Unit tests have been written using pytest.
- To run the tests:
  ```bash
  pytest test_project.py

## 📌 Motivation
This project is part of a personal learning journey. I’m using it to:

  - Practice real-world Python programming

  - Understand data persistence with JSON

  - Learn basic testing and version control

  - Build discipline through the very tool I'm coding

## 🤝 Contributions
  This is a solo learning project, but feedback, ideas, and friendly pointers are always welcome.
