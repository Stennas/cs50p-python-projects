# Harvard CS50P – Python Projects & Exercises

This repository contains my personal solutions to Harvard's **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)**. The course builds a solid foundation in computer science and Python programming through practical, hands-on problems and real-world logic.

## ✅ What I Learned

- Variables, types, and user input
- Conditionals and loops
- Functions and parameters
- File I/O and error handling
- Python libraries (e.g., `random`, `requests`)
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Regular expressions
- APIs and JSON
- Building complete CLI projects
